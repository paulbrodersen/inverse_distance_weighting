Inverse distance weighting (IDW)
--------------------------------

Compute the score of query points based on the scores of their k-nearest neighbours,
weighted by the inverse of their distances.

Example:
--------

# import idw

# 'train'
idw_tree = idw.tree(X1, z1)

# 'test'
spacing = np.linspace(-5., 5., 100)
X2 = np.meshgrid(spacing, spacing)
grid_shape = X2[0].shape
X2 = np.reshape(X2, (2, -1)).T
z2 = idw_tree(X2)


For a more complete example see demo().
